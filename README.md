# AIRLINE-RESERVATION-SYSTEM-JSP-

Airline reservation System is a computerized system used to store and retrieve
information and conduct transactions related to air travel. The project is aimed at
exposing the relevance and importance of Airline Reservation Systems. It is projected towards enhancing the relationship between customers and airline agencies through the use of ARSs, and thereby making it convenient for the customers to book the flights as when they require such that they can utilize this software to make reservations.
This software has two parts. First is user part and the administrator part. User
part is used as a front end and administrator is the back end. Administrator is used by airline authority. It will allow the customers to access database and allow new customers to sign up for online access.
The system allows the airline passenger to search for flights that are available
between the two travel cities, namely the “Departure city” and “Arrival city” for a
particular departure and arrival dates. The system displays all the flight’s details such as flight no, name, price and duration of journey etc.
After search the system display list of available flights and allows customer to
choose a particular flight. Then the system checks for the availability of seats on the flight. If the seats are available then the system allows the passenger to book a seat.
Otherwise it asks the user to choose another flight.
To book a flight the system asks the customer to enter his details such as name,
address, city, state, and credit card number and contact number. Then it checks the validity of card and book the flight and update the airline database and user database. The system also allows the customer to cancel his/her reservation, if any problem occurs.
The main purpose of this software is to reduce the manual errors involved in the
airline reservation process and make it convenient for the customers to book the flights as when they require such that they can utilize this software to make reservations, modify reservations or cancel a particular reservation.
